# GaussJordan

My name is Emanuel Rico Martinez, actually I study in Universidad Autónoma de San Luis Potosí, Mexico. This is a 
GaussJordan program made in Visual Studio with console application in C#, with the program you can use the GaussJordanç
algorithm with any size of the array {3x3, 4x4, 5x5, etc.}.
